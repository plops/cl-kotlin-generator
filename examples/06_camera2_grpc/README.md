- i want to expose camera2 functionality with a grpc interface

# grpc
- i haven't found proper instructions how to add grpc server to an
  android studio project
  - i watched this video but it didn't help with my issue: https://youtu.be/88syHWoe6fc
- wire seems to be installable for android: https://square.github.io/wire/#wire-kotlin
- maybe wire is easier to install than grpc 

# camera2 

- this video is good for camera2 https://youtu.be/S-7H72UTiBU
