  - create class to return multiple values
  - data class auto-generates equal, hash code, string
  - property set, get, by lazy <lambda>; by Delegates.observable
  - why does kotlin have so many implicit things. i won't remember that. i don't like that
  - don't use var, use val
  - if can return value
  - numbers.filter{it%16==0}.also{print(it)}
  - inline function to make green lambda less heavy
  - coroutine async vs thread
